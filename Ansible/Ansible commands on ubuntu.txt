sudo apt update      it will update the instances
sudo apt install ansible
cd .ssh       create directory
vim folder name   create folder where we can store key

creating inventory path
mkdir ansible
cd ansible/
vim hosts

[servers]
server1 ansible_host=ip address
server2 ansible_host=ip address
server3 ansible_host=ip address

[all:vars]
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

ansible-inventory --list -y -i /path where inventory has been saved
it will give the details which has been stored in invenotry

to access the private key give permission first by going main path
ubuntu@ip-172-31-92-186:~$      eg
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh/ansible_key2(key has been stored)


ansible all -m ping -i /path where inventory has been saved --private-key= ~/path where ansible key has been stored   

ansible all -a "free -h" -i /path where inventory has been saved --private-key= ~/path where ansible key has been stored
